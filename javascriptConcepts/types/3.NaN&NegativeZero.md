# #1 NaN

### It is referred to as an 'invalid number'

```javascript
var myMarks = Number("n/a") //NaN
```
 - NaN's are not equal to each other
 ```javascript
 myMarks === myMarks //false
 ```
 - In case of undefined two undefined are always equal to each other.So to check whether a NaN is actually NaN, we use  'isNaN'
  ```javascript
 Number.isNaN(myMarks) //true
 ```

 - If you perform any operation with NaN , it will always return NaN . For eg:

 ```javascript
 myAge - 'my cat's age'  // NaN
 typeOf(myAge) //number ?? 
 //type of an invalid number is also a number (it means i didnt find it)(IEEE 754)
  ```
 
 # #2 Negative Zero

- Negative representation of zero
- But the interesting part is when we strigify our trendRate it returns 0 and also our negative zero is neither less than zero nor greater than 0.

```javascript
var trendRate = -0;
trendRate === -0 // true 

trendRate.toString() // "0" ??
trendRate === 0; // true ??
trendRate < 0;  // false
trendRate > 0; //false
```

- So to solve this issue, we have a new built-in checker called Object.is

```javascript
Object.is(trendRate,-0); //true
Object.is(trendRate,0); //false
```

- Why to use negative zeros? 
   The absolute value of number zeroes is used to calculate how to calculate how fast something might be moving while the sign represents in which direction it is moving.This concept is very helpful in video games like determining where car is moving.Similarly in stock prices also,it is useful

- Math.sign is  utility which is used to return -1 or 1 depending on whether a number is carrying a positive or a negative sign bit but in the case of  negative zero, it returns -0 and 0;

```javascript
Math.sign(-3) //-1
Math.sign(3) //1
Math.sign(-0) //-0 ?
Math.sign(0) // 0 ?
```
- So to fix this, what we do is create our own sign function : 
```javascript
function sign(v){
   return v !==0 ? Math.sign(v) : Object.is(v,-0) ? -1 : 1; 
}

sign(-3) //-1
sign(3) //1
sign(-0) //-1
sign(-0) //1
```
